# AndroidProject

Hello, and welcome to my Android Project. I will be making a simple messaging application, inspired by the likes of Messanger, WhatsApp etc. 
The idea is that a person will enter the app either as a guest or log in with their account and hold conversations with other users in the app. As for the requirements...


MUST HAVE:
1. The app must have the option to let the users enter either with their account or as guests
2. The app must have the option for users to send and receive messages in a common chat area.

SHOULD HAVE:
1. The app should have a list (as a sidebar) in which all the active users, as well as guests are being displayed.
2. The app should have an option for the registered users to have conversations in private, on a separate window.
3. The app should have an option for the registered users to log out of their accounts.

COULD HAVE:
1. The app could have the option for the registered users to edit their profile with their personal information, like name, age, email etc.
2. The app could have the option for registered users to set their status as online or offline.
3. The app could have the option for registered users to send friend requests to each other.

WON'T HAVE:
1. The app won't have support for images and/or emojis.
2. The app won't have support for voice messages or videos.
